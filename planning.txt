EXPLOSIONS
Meet our hero,
{{your-name}},
a super intelligent
{{occupation}}.
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, a run in with
{{villain}},
--<his/her>
arch-nemesis leads
to the creation of
--<his//her>>
alter ego,
{{hero-1}} {{hero-2}},
a
{{color}}
giant capable of mass-destruction.

One day, a(n)
{{animal}}
explodes, causing the entire city of
{{city}}
to burst into flames.
{{hero-1}} {{hero-2}}'s
super tingly super senses alert
--<him/her>
to the danger.
Soon,
--<he/she>
realizes that
{{villain}}
is once again stirring up trouble.

While on
--<his/her>
way to the scene of the explosion,
--<he//she>
teams up with an incredibly attractive
--<man//woman>
named
{{persons-name}},
who has an incredibly shaped
<body-part>.
--<he/she>
may be from the streets, but
--<he/she>
can
{{verb}} l
like nobody's business.

The duo decide to turn the tables on
{{villain}}
by blowing up a
{{noun4}},
which triggers a chain reaction, causing the local
{{restaurant-name}},
and the famous
{{historic monument}}
to explode and rain down even more flames and cutlery and body parts on the already terrified citizens of
{{city}}.

In the midst of all this chaos, the bad guys helicopter gets
{{verb3}}
by a piece of
{{food}}
from when the
{{restaurant-name}}
exploded. This causes yet another explosion which unfortunately shoots a fireball straight into the heart of
{{persons-name}}
but on the bright side.. it also destroys
{{villain}}at the same time.

THE END.
